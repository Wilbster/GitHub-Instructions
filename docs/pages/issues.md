## Overview

In this section we will be going over how to utilize **Github issues** to create a new issue as well as other various features that it offers. It is a powerful tool that allows users to keep track of their progress and issues that they may encounter in a work environment.

**Github issue** is a tool where users can track and manage tasks associated with a project. It is commonly utilized to report bugs, ask for features, or suggest modifications to a project.

The issue is created by any user and it can contain a title, description, and other information including labels, assignees, and milestones

- `assignees` : people responsible for resolving the issue
- `milestones` : used to group similar issues together and track the progress towards a larger goal
