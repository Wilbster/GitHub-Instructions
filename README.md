# GitHub-Instructions
3 Different Tasks in Github

Hello there! This documentation will help your journey in understanding and learning how to use [**github**](https://github.com/) to create new projects and begin your journey as software developers using this essential technology.

The following content will be talked about within this documentation

- Merging changes while working on a group project
- Creating issues using github
- Placeholder

## Our Collaboration Process

This user documentation assignment was completed as we discussed our goals and features we would like to implement in person and via discord. We brainstormed what we would like to showcase to users in the first week and decided on the specifics we hoped to go over.

We utilized VScode and Github to merge all our changes into the main branch to complete the project.

## Our resources

The user documentation was created using our knowledge that we amassed during term 1 & 2 of BCIT CST through a lot of trial and error. We also used documentation of the official [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) to add on to our knowledge for specifics that we were unsure about. We tried to make the instructions very simple and clear to ensure that readers would be able to follow along with ease.

## Using MKDocs

We had never been exposed to MKDocs before this assignment and decided we would like to use one of the themes listed within the site. Being able to install and follow the user manual gave us inspiration when creating the user documentation for github.

## Using MarkDown

We had never used MarkDown for a project before other than writing README.md so it was a good experience getting to work with new technology. 

## Tone of User Documentation

The user documentation is written for the following audience.

- Beginner software developers who have been newly exposed to github and want to learn more about the correct way to use this essential tool.
- Software developers who have not been exposed to specific features that github offers

With this in mind, we chose to write more concise instructions so that new users would not be overwhelmed and be able to follow along with ease. Jargon that would require more knowledge has been explained more in-depth in the terminology section of the user documentation.

## Conclusion

This user documentation is a compilation of our research and general knowledge of some of the features that github offers for their users. Through writing these documentations, it also enhanced our own abilities and understanding of the technology as we tried to recall the steps that we took ourselves to absorb the knowledge that we obtained.

Through the project, we were also able to improve on using github commands as well because of the numerous git pull/push commands that were used when we were making changes to the project.

We would like to express our appreciation for utilizing our Github User Documentation Guide and hope it has been a valuable experience.
